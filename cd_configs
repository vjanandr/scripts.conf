Try fastcd (https://github.com/frazenshtein/fastcd) It sets hook that records visited directories from bash. And sets script as "j" alias, that shows you the last visited directories, with the ability to quickly cd (start typing to filter directories). Modification of .bashrc is required to make the "j" alias.

Getting tool

cd ~; mkdir Soft; cd Soft
git clone https://github.com/frazenshtein/fastcd
Install required modules

pip install --user urwid
Source the set.sh file into your bashrc

echo -e "\nsource /home/$USER/Soft/fastcd/set.sh\n" >> ~/.bashrc
And update bashrc

source ~/.bashrc
Then just type "j" in console
